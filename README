kmod - Linux kernel module handling

OVERVIEW
========

kmod is a set of tools to handle common tasks with Linux kernel modules like
insert, remove, list, check properties, resolve dependencies and aliases.

These tools are designed on top of libkmod, a library that is shipped with
kmod. See libkmod/README for more details on this library and how to use it.
The aim is to be compatible with tools, configurations and indexes from
module-init-tools project.

Compilation and installation
============================

In order to compiler the source code you need following software packages:
	- GCC compiler
	- GNU C library

Optional dependencies:
	- ZLIB library
	- LZMA library

Typical configuration:
	./configure CFLAGS="-g -O2" --prefix=/usr \
			--sysconfdir=/etc --libdir=/usr/lib

Configure automatically searches for all required components and packages.

To compile and install run:
	make && make install

Hacking
=======

Run 'bootstrap' script before configure. If you want to accept the recommended
flags, you just need to run 'bootstrap-configure'.

Make sure to read the CODING-STYLE file.
